## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

I tried to use Tailwind CSS for the first time, and it was a great experience. Although, with the new version of Tailwind CSS, I had some difficulty to install it and even if I followed every instruction, there are some aspects that still didn't work rendering the end-product lacking.

### Continued development

I will use more Tailwind CSS and understand all the different components and layers and even the side-effects of it.

### Useful resources
